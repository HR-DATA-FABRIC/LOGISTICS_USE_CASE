# AIM and Scope
This E-learning course codifies best practices & ethical considerations on data driven infrastructure and logistics 4.0. by drawing up a common vocabulary between data science & data engineering (Moubayed et al., 2018; Murtaza et al., 2022).

This is achieved through a hands-on implementation —by means of a [CoLab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PPT7-kUJjDcK4sTbSyE0aM4k33VLVm5j?usp=sharing) —of a basic infrastructure stack —equipment and structures—needed to solve logistics 4.0 use-cases from a data science viewpoint, the so-called DSI-stack.

After introducing the data driven logistics 4.0 business logic, along with the CRISP-DM workflow, we follow the journey of a novice data scientist.

The data scientist’s goal is to put together a custom-made DSI-stack aimed to develop a machine learning model to forecast whether ordered products are delivered on time or not. The dataset is described and accessible as a .csv file on the Kaggle data science community platform.

In this way, we keep the discussed knowledge & skills —needed to build a custom data pipeline—more concrete and grounded to real-world problems.

After completion of this course, you have a basic understanding of what kind of infrastructure stack is needed to develop and deliver data-driven solutions for the logistics Industry.

In addition, you will learn how to use ChatGPT to get a better understanding of the presented course materials through a set of predefined prompts.

## Who should follow this course?
Bachelor students who want to experience hands-on what kind of toolchains and hardware is needed to solve data driven logistics use cases in real-world business environments. 

Even if you don’t have a background in infrastructure, data science and/or data engineering. This also counts for representatives from small/medium enterprises with no background on this topic.
